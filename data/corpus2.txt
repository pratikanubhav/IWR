The Americans say Germany is having it too good and is not paying for the past or for the present . The Adenauer Government flatly rejected attempts by the Eisenhower Government to get them to pay a regular sum towards the cost of keeping American troops in Germany . These support costs are a big drain on America's dollar reserves . Dr. Adenauer's answer is the once-and-for-all cash offer of 357million . President Kennedy's rejection of it is a painful blow to the West German Government .

George Brown CHILDREN TWO men who are poles apart in personality last night dominated Mr. Brown , passionate and warm-hearted , led Labour's attack on the higher health charges .

Mr. Brown declared that the policy under censure was monstrous . It had offended many people far beyond the ranks of Labour supporters . The Press , many doctors and public were denouncing the proposals . He quoted from this letter which Mr. Gaitskell had received : " My background is a doctor of 68 , who has practised medicine for 43 years , chiefly as a panel doctor . " I am a lifelong Conservative . I am horrified and amazed by my party's proposal to prostitute the whole principle of the State service and to render that service a hardship to poor people . " After a lifetime of helping others and healing the sick , my considered opinion is that anybody supporting the increased charges is a wicked , old - . " Mr. Brown went on : " We are dealing with a noble edifice which needs an imaginative architect to improve it , but it has got a quantity surveyor . We have descended from the real problems to fiddling about with bills of cost .

In fact , the Tories made it worse now for the sick and needy than Labour had to make it in 1950 . And as a percentage of social service expenditure , health had fallen from 28.5 to 23.1 per cent. Then Mr. Brown swung his attack directly to the unsmiling Mr. . He demanded that instead of taking it out of the patients Mr. Powell should take ruthless action against the drug making industry , whose profits had risen by up to 400 per cent. in the last eight years .

Macmillan has picked a strong " brains trust " team to negotiate terms for joining the Common Market . And he has abandoned plans to visit President de Gaulle this month to smooth the way . General de Gaulle's official welcome last week to Britain's moves towards the Six was taken as a friendly gesture in Whitehall , but no more than that . So the idea of personal mission by the Prime Minister to Paris was dropped Instead Mr. Macmillan will rely on a hand-picked team under the leadership of Sir Pierson Dixon , Britain's Ambassador to France , to back Mr. Edward Heath , Lord Privy Seal , who is charged with the conduct of negotiations with the Six . At the same time the Prime Minister has offered Commonwealth Governments every facility possible to safeguard their interests Seven Commonwealth countries have told Mr. Sandys , Commonwealth Relations Secretary , that they wish to be kept in touch in London . Three of them - Canada , Australia , New Zealand - will have strong delegations at an opening meeting in London on Monday . Once the Common Market's Council of Ministers draws up the procedure for negotiations in a fortnight's time , these Commonwealth countries can arrange for observers to advise the British negotiating team . The team is composed of experienced negotiators in several fields . Sir Pier- son Dixon has a wide reputation as a skilful backstage negotiator since his days as Britain's chief UN dele- gate . Second in command is Mr. Eric Roll , 53-year-old Deputy Secre- tary at the Ministry of Agriculture , Food , and Fisheries . The Foreign Office is represented by Sir Roderick Barclay Other leading members are : Sir Henry Lintott from the Commonwealth Relations Office , Sir William Corell-Barnes ( Colonial Office ) , Mr. G. R. Bell ( Treasury ) , and Mr. G. H. Andrew ( Board of Trade ) . They will accompany Mr. Heath next month when he goes to Brussels , headquarters of the Common Market Commission , or wherever the Six decide negotiations should be held . Some of the problems were reviewed yesterday at a meeting in Paris between M. Couve de Murville , French Foreign Minister , and Mr. Heath . MR. Selwyn Lloyd - a man with troubles enough back home - seems fated to fly into trouble abroad . Last year it was the riots in Istanbul , which enlivened the NATO Council meeting . Now we have the strikes and demonstrations in Ghana coinciding with the meeting of the Com- monwealth Economic Consultative Council - the first to be held in Africa . Only a few hours af- ter Mr Lloyd and his 24-strong delegation landed at Accra this morning , hundreds of shop assistants demonstrated outside the British-owned Kingsway Stores , the largest in town . The stores had been hit by the same strike wave that has paralysed the port of Takoradi for the past week . Root of the discontent : The austerity Budget , including a compulsory savings scheme which the Ghana Government introduced in July . Ghana's strong man is not here to face the storm . President Nkrumah , having made his contribution to the neutrals' conference in Belgrade , has resumed his holiday on the Black Sea and no one here professes to know when he will return . But in his absence his chief lieutenants have not let him down . The strong arm of authority has been raised against the strikers and is now beginning to tell . Today's Ghanaian Times ( motto : " The welfare of the people is the supreme law " ) reports : " The Government has been urged to take immediate ac- tion to deal ruthlessly with the strikers . " The urge came from a conference of activists of Nkrumah's Convention Party " after powerful addresses by Comrades Krobo Edusei , Tawia Adamafio , " and others . Strong deeds followed strong words . In Takoradi a " limited state of emergency " was declared , giving the Government adequate power to maintain all essential services and ensure food supplies . Thus it becomes an offence punishable with imprisonment for anyone who " publishes a report likely to cause alarm or prejudicial to public safety . " And up to ten years' imprisonment can be imposed on anyone convicted of sabotage . These stern measures had the desired effect today at Kumasi where the strikers gave in , but in Takoradi , the chief storm centre , they are still holding out despite the presence of 1,400 police and 16 armoured cars . And how did the Government react when the strikers demonstrated in Accra ? At 9.40 Mr. Edusei , Minister of Transport and pro- bably the toughest man in Mr. Nkrumah's team , drove up to the Kingsway Stores and faced the demonstrators , most of them shopgirls in overalls . " If you have not dispersed by ten o'clock , " he told them , ' the police will act . ' At five to ten a posse of police arrived and in less than two minutes the crowd had gone . If the threatened " counter-revolution " was not * to bring the President back from his travels it might have been thought that the muster from the 13 States of the Commonwealth was an occasion worthy of his presence . After all it was Mr. Nkrumah who suggested that this year the Economic Consultative Council should meet in Accra . * enough It has been left , however , to Mr. Goka , Ghana's Finance Minister , to do the honours as host , in which capacity he held a reception tonight in Accra's Ambassador Hotel . POLICE , on direct orders from the Cabinet , are openly intimidating members of Earl Russell's nuclear- disarming Committee of 100 , the Committee claimed yesterday . It said pressure was being put on members and associates all over the country . It alleged : Phones were being tapped and going out of action ; Police were visiting people " on no pretext whatsoever , except to pass the time of day " ; Supporters had been warned - one that his connection with the committee was going too far ; another that anti-apartheid agitation was all right , but support for the committee was not . A third man's house was watched for four days by plain-clothes men . Committee-member Mr. George Clark commented at a Press conference : " The most extraordinary things are happening . " Fifty committee members will appear at Bow-street today , including Lord Russell , Lady Russell , Lord Boyd-Orr , the Rev. Michael Scott , and Mr. Clark . They are required to show why they should not be bound over for disturbing the peace and for inciting a breach of the peace . The summonses say they are " likely to persevere in such unlawful conduct . " Lord Russell , 89 , was putting his affairs in order , and packing a case , at his Chelsea home yesterday . His secretary , American-born Mr. Ralph Schoenman , said : " He is not going to agree to be bound over . That will probably mean jail and , though frail , he is very fit and will take the rigours of prison in his stride . He hopes to be allowed to do some writing . " Back at the Press conference , Mr. Clark said two committee members tried a " plant " call on suspect phone . They discussed a sit-down at Watford at 5.30 p.m. - none was planned but police turned up . Sir Roy Welensky said today that he no longer accepted the good faith of Mr. Kenneth Kaunda . Sir Roy , Federal Rhodesian Prime Minister , said that Mr. Kaunda's United National Independence Party was a monster as vicious as the Zambia National Congress , which was led by Mr. Kaunda until he was outlawed in 1959 . The record of lawlessness among UNIP supporters went back a long way , Sir Roy told the Federal Parliament in Salisbury . He cited cases in which hundreds of UNIP supporters had been arrested or convicted since last year on charges of creating disturbances . During the first three weeks of the present trouble 287 incidents had been reported in Northern Rhodesia . More than 500 people - 167 of them members of the UNIP - were convicted last month in the Northern Province alone . " Against this background must be taken Mr. Kaunda's repeated statements that all he is doing is in the name of non-violence , " said Sir Roy . " I am now compelled to say that I don't accept his good faith . " He said Mr. Kaunda must know that his statements had stimulated violence , but he had done nothing to stop it . " It is true he made a point of again being absent from Northern Rhodesia when his followers have indulged in such violence . " But Sir Roy pointed out that a few months ago Mr. Kaunda said that if UNIP did not get its way what would happen would make the Mau Mau in Kenya " seem like a child's picnic . " JOHN DICKIE writes : Mr. Macmillan gave top priority to the clash over Northern Rhodesia on his return from Scotland yesterday . He summoned Mr. Iain Macleod , Colonial Secretary , and Mr. Duncan Sandys , Commonwealth Relations Secretary for an hour's talks at Admiralty House . A statement is expected today to hold the door open for modifications to the new Constitution provided law and order is maintained in Northern Rhodesia . Its terms have set the Prime Minister an exacting problem . Mr. Sandys has warned of the risk of a strong reaction from Sir Roy Welensky to any suggestion that there may be fresh concessions to the African nationalists . Mr. Macleod has ample evidence from talks with Sir John Moffat , Northern Rhodesian Liberal leader , and Mr. Kaunda , that the bulk of moderates and Africans will reject the Constitution unless it is modified . A ROYAL welcome for the Kabaka of Buganda ( King Freddie ) from Princess Elizabeth Bagaya of Toro , kneeling at the foot of his airliner's steps at London Airport yesterday . Forty other Africans greeted him , kneeling with heads bowed . The princess , aged 24 , is now studying history at Cambri- dge , where she is a friend of Prince William of Gloucester . King Freddie and three other hereditary rulers of native kingdoms in Uganda arrived for talks with Colonial Secretary Mr. Iain Macleod , before the Uganda Constitutional conference opens next Monday . The question : Their status in an independent Uganda . The thorniest problem for next week's conference is to settle the relationships between them and the rest of the country . A Government report has recognised their rights and recommended a form of federal association , but the four kings are not Instead , the kings will remain in London and wait to hear the conference's proposals . Then their views will be transmitted back . MR. BUTLER , the Home Secretary , has decided to meet head-on the biggest challenge to Government authority yet presented by the " Ban-the-Bomb " demonstrators . Police leave has been cancelled and secret plans prepared to deal with the mass sit-down rally planned for Sunday in Parliament-square by the Committee of 100 , the anti-nuclear arms group . It was Mr. Butler who authorised action which ended yesterday in 32 members of the Committee of 100 being imprisoned for inciting a breach of the peace . The committee's president 89-year-old Earl Russell and his 61-year-old wife were each jailed for a week . Playwrights Arnold Wesker ( The Kitchen ) and Robert Bolt ( The Flowering Cherry ) were jailed for a month . The possibility that the Government might invoke the Public Order Act , 1936 , and declare the whole rally illegal - whether the demonstrators sit down or not - was being discussed in Whitehall last night . It was last used a year ago , to deal with the St. Pancras rent riots . Today Mr. Butler will have talks with Police Commissioner Sir Joseph Simpson to draw up final plans for the " Battle of Parliament Square . " Measures agreed so far include : 1 . A mass call-out of police , special constables and reserves , with 750 policemen posted from outlying districts to stations in the area - West End Central , Bow-street , and Cannon-row . Today , for example , the Foreign Minister of Indo- nesia arrived in Belgrade as the guest of the Yugoslav Foreign Minister . In fact such Yugoslav activity has been # particularly intensified in the past year or so and though so far , apart from joint action in the United Nations , these exchanges have not been seen on any wider basis , President Tito is known for some time to have favoured a conference of neutralist leaders . The wish was particularly apparent in comments on the occasion of the conference in Casablanca and , in particular , in Yugoslav approval of the idea of an inter-African consultative assembly which would coordinate activity on the political and economic sphere ; and it is not difficult to see that President Tito would like some such idea extended also to the whole uncommitted world But he now feels , in view of a changed international situation and especially in view of fresh problems facing the new and independent countries of Africa , that the time is ripe to have more frequent consultations between the uncommitted countries and even to work out common stands on various problems facing those nations . Two subjects , the Congo and Algeria , are the main topics of the talks in Belgrade - and on both the two leaders have identical ideas . Two emissaries from the Laotian Government of Prince Boun Oum have arrived in Phnom Penh , Cambodia , to invite Prince Souvanna Phouma , the former Prime Min- ister , to return to Laos . No details of their mission have been disclosed , but it was reported earlier in Laos that Prince Boun Oum was considering asking Prince Souvanna Phouma to join his Government . Prince Souvanna Phouma has not yet replied to the mission , but recent statements made by him in Phnom Penh indicate that he still regards himself as the only legal Prime Minister of Laos . His policy of strict neutrality from 1951 to 1958 kept the kingdom in peace , though at the cost of virtual partition of the country into the pro-communist north and the pro-western centre and south . Prince Souvanna's former Minister of Information , Mr. Quinim Pholsena , who claims to be his representative in Laos , yesterday addressed all officers of the pro-communist forces occupying the province of Xieng Khouang and emphasized that Prince Souphannouvong , leader of the pro-communist Neo Lao Haksat Party , also to the officers in the same terms . This emphasis on the legality of the former Government suggests that all is not well with the political and military leadership of the pro-communists . Most of the province of Xieng Khouang and the tactically useful Plain of Jars , however , appear still to be firmly in their hands . The Government has claimed the recapture of Vang Vieng , the pro- communists' former base 60 miles north of Vientiane , but this claim A correspondent who travelled yesterday to within a few miles of Vang Vieng was told by officers that this village was still held by the pro-communists . With the Prime Minister sunning himself in Jamaica and # his Cabinet out in the grass roots making 160 speeches in 80 constituencies in 10 days , the Liberal Party are holding a national conference here with some 2,000 delegates , the biggest gathering since 1958 when Mr. Lester Pearson was chosen as party leader . In some ways it will be a testing occasion for him , although some think his position unassailable simply because there is no one else in sight to supplant him . So the con- ference will concentrate on laying the foundations on which to win the next election . The rally comes at a time when in spite of carefully worded state- ments by the Prime Minister there is an air of electoral expectancy . Members of the Cabinet are basing their speeches on a new
